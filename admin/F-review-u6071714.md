Review Comments:

1. HelloWorld.java:1-16 Use proper capitalization.
2. HelloWorldTest.java:21 This test will pass with "hello world", when it should fail.
3.In terms of task5,it can work  well. and could pass all the test.
4.For more detials.It looks long,for some code ,for example for the "if" condition.the satsfied condition could 
write a new method tojustify.So it may look more clear.
5.In terms of the represent I think it may use asscii and loop to represent.
6.It can work well.I think it is the best feature of the code.
7.the structure and class is appropriate .
8.And the name is also good,it is easy to understand which method is used.
9.And there is commit on it.
10.
