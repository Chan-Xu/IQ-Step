I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* I finished Task2, part of Task3, Task5 and Task6.

* I create two tool classes which represent encoding of 8 pieces and the board.

* I am proud of the action which I encoding all pieces by numbers:'0','1','2' to be some 3*3 grids and flip and rotate them with the methods: flip & rotate.

* The class Piece which encoding pieces by numbers:'0','1','2' and the encoding board positions in class GameBoard are very useful when I place pieces into the board.

* The checkNeighbours method in class GameBoard which is the core part of Task6 helps a lot in checking obstruction between pieces.  


I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of using this great framework to make the game run faster came from a discussion with Yuze Gong(u5640420).

* The code in class <GameBoard> uses an idea suggested by Yuze Gong(u5640420).
