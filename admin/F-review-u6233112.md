Review Comments:

1. StepsGame.java:50-86 Use proper capitalization.

    The best features of this code is the good logic in line 54-69.
    
    The code is well-documented and the program decomposition is appropriate.
    
    It follows Java code conventions and the style consistent is throughout.
   
2. Board.java:25-78 For this part, it can create a window.
    
    The code is not well-documented(for example there are not good commits to explain the function) but the program decomposition is appropriate.
    
    I suspect that there are some errors in the code. The code is not incomplete which cannot implement a basic playable Steps Game in JavaFX.
